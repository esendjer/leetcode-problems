# 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes

[783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/description/)


- **Space complexity**: Because this solution use _Recursion_ approach for the average and the best cases it's ${ O(log n) }$, and ${ O(n) }$ for the worse case; where `n` amount of nodes (vertex) in the entire tree.
- **Time complexity**: Each of the nodes within the tree is touched (passed, visited) just once, but all of them is touched so that it's ${ O(n) }$
