# leetcode-problems

As it was mentioned in the description of the repository, here I'm publishing my progress in LeetCode problem solving.

For sure, there are no any needs to create one more repo or site where hundreds times solved problem would be solved for one more time... no any needs, except a very one - I'm  doing this for myself.

I want to familiarize myself with algorithms and data structures, develope up my dev and analytics skills to become a better developer today than yesterday's me.
