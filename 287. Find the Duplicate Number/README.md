[287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

Here is [Python](./python) and [Go](./go) solutions

[`Makefile`](Makefile) is used to perform tests
```bash
make # by default and runs all tests
make py-test # runs only python's tests
make go-test # runs only go's tests
```

# follow-ups
Also, there are the next Follow-ups, that have not been covered:
* How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
* Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity
