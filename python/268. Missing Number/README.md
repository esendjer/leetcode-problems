# 268. Missing Number

Here was used just Python's embedded functions without any optimization.

There is a follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

Because of that the Pythons `sum` has O(n) complexity it could be count as a successfully done.
