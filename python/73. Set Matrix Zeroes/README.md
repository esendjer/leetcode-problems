# 73. Set Matrix Zeroes

[73. Set Matrix Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)

* `setZeroes` - the first
* `setZeroes` - the second

Both are use integers (in a binary representation) to sore 0-filled rows, while the second does this for columns as well.

These solutions have $O(1)$ extra space and $O( M \times N)$ time complexity.

But, I suppose, it could be improved with removed...
